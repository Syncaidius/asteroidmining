Asteroid Mining Addon for GMod
==============================

I no longer work on any of my Garry's Mod addons so feel free to fork this and use any parts (*or the whole*) of it for your own mods.

How does it work?
-----------------
Asteroids spawn which contain resources/minerals of varying rarity and mining difficulty. 
Some resources take longer to mine than others, some appear less/more often than others, and so on. 
Every single asteroid contains a percentage of rock, which is of course, what holds most asteroids together anyway.
Every asteroid will contain at least 1 usable mineable resource, some may contain more however.

Basic Rules/Tips/Hints
----------------------
1) Rock is a waste product and cannot be used for anything. If your rock storages get full, your mining laser(s) will shut off until you recycle the rock.
2) All ores mined from asteroids require refining before the resource can be used on anything, like RL mining, to remove the rock/crap from the ore.
3) Once an asteroids main resources are mined out, it will disappear and free up a slot ready for a new asteroid to spawn. 
4) Rock DOES NOT count towards an asteroids main resources, it is there to get in your way only. :P


Console Commands
----------------
 - **AM_asteroidlimit** - Sets the maximum number of asteroids allowed on the map. Be warned, high numbers of asteroids may cause lag and even crash the server after a while.
 - **AM_respawn_time** - Sets the number of seconds between asteroid respawn-check cycles
 - **AM_respawn_count** - The maximum number of asteroids allowed to respawn per cycle (this is not always reached however)
 - **AM_respawn_maxlife** - Sets the number of minutes an asteroid can be left untouched for, before deleting itself and freeing up an asteroid spawn slot
